# Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Description

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}. 

## Examples

```
Input: arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output: Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 10, 20}
```
